# About the South London Singers

**SLS is a small Beckenham choir made up of a diverse group of around 30 local singers.**

We perform a mixture of old and new sacred and secular choral music, but are not a religious choir.

We perform around four concerts per year. This means each term we can devote plenty of rehearsal time to learning our concert pieces. So you won't need to do too much 'homework'!

We are not required to be fluent sight-readers but are expected to be able to use our scores to sing accurately and to note down the Musical Director's guidance.

We like to have fun at our rehearsals and many of us enjoy socialising around our rehearsals' start and end times. We hold a few social events for choir members throughout the season.

We are [a registered charity](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/charity-details/800934/charity-overview) and are managed by a board of elected Trustees.

Current trustees are:

**Chair:** David Peters<br>
**Secretary:** Tom Walters<br>
**Treasurer:** Emily Seymour<br>
**Trustee:** David Jackson<br>
**Trustee:** Mary Jackson<br>
**Trustee:** Patricia Cummings

You can contact the trustees by emailing <info@southlondonsingers.com>.

# What sort of music do we sing?

We perform from a wide-ranging [repertoire](https://southlondonsingers.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SLS_Repertoire.pdf), which covers both secular and sacred music from the fifteenth century to the present. Most of our repertoire is performed in four parts (SATB), either a cappella or with organ, piano or light instrumental accompaniment suited to a smaller chamber group.

Familiar composers such as Handel, Bach and Britten feature alongside lesser-known composers such as Joseph Jongen and Michael Haydn.

We sing a variety of well-known pieces alongside new discoveries - and have even debuted some brand-new pieces written for us by local composers and friends of the choir.

## Music Hire
