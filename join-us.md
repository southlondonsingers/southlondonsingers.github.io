# How to join the South London Singers

# **Join our South London choir**

Whether you're a soprano, alto, tenor or bass, we'd love to welcome you to join our group.

We sing from sheet music, so experience of singing in choral groups and the ability to read music are desirable. However, if you're a good singer but not confident at sight-reading, we'd always suggest you try out a couple of rehearsals and see what you think.

The main requirement is to be enthusiastic about singing and to enjoy our repertoire of choral classics.

You won't be auditioned as we hope most singers will have a sense of whether or not the SLS is right for them.

We welcome any prospective singers to come along and try the choir out for free.

**Scroll down for all the practical details you'll need about our rehearsals.**

Once you've decided to join us, full-time members will be asked to pay our standard subscription fees of £240 a year. These are to cover the costs of our rehearsal space, accompanists and musical direction, and can be paid either annually or by term (£80 per term - Sept-Dec; Jan-March; April-July).

Our three terms follow the academic year with short breaks over Christmas and Easter and a long summer break from July - September.

Prospective new members can come along to any Monday evening rehearsal and try us out. Here's our current [rehearsal schedule](documents/schedule-2025-spring-summer.pdf).

**Let us know to expect you by emailing us at info@southlondonsingers.com**

Alternatively you call call us on 020 8656 2815.

# What sort of music do we sing?

We perform from a wide-ranging [repertoire](documents/repertoire.pdf), which covers both secular and sacred music from the fifteenth century to the present. Most of our repertoire is performed in four parts (SATB), either a cappella or with organ, piano or light instrumental accompaniment suited to a smaller chamber group.

Familiar composers such as Handel, Bach and Britten feature alongside lesser-known composers such as Joseph Jongen and Michael Haydn.

We sing a variety of well-known pieces alongside new discoveries - and have even debuted some brand-new pieces written for us by local composers and friends of the choir.

## Music Hire

The SLS owns sets of some of the music we have performed and is willing to hire these out to other choirs. Click here to find our [music hire list](documents/hirelist.pdf).

If you are interested in hiring some of our sets of scores, please [email us](mailto:info@southlondonsingers.com) for details of our charges and other terms.
